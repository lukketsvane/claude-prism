## Why ClaudePrism?

[OpenAI Prism](https://openai.com/prism/) is a cloud-based LaTeX workspace for scientists — free, powerful, but **your unpublished research lives on OpenAI's servers**. Experts have raised concerns about intellectual property exposure and whether OpenAI could claim rights over researcher data. By default, content may be used to train future models unless you opt out.

ClaudePrism takes a different approach: **everything runs locally on your machine.**

| | OpenAI Prism | ClaudePrism |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| AI Model | GPT-5.2 (cloud) | **Claude Opus / Sonnet / Haiku (local CLI)** |
| Runtime | Browser (cloud) | **Native desktop (Tauri 2 + Rust)** |
| LaTeX | Cloud compilation | **Tectonic (embedded, offline)** |
| Getting Started | Account setup required | **Install and go — template gallery + project wizard** |
| Version Control | — | **Git-based history with labels & diff** |
| Data Privacy | Cloud storage, [trains models by default](https://openai.com/policies/how-your-data-is-used-to-improve-model-performance/) | **Local execution, [opt-out available](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/data-usage)** |
| Source Code | Proprietary | **Open source (MIT)** |

### Your Research, Your Machine

ClaudePrism invokes the **Claude CLI** as a local subprocess. Your documents stay on disk — only prompts are sent to the Claude API for inference.

**How the two compare on data:**

| | OpenAI Prism | ClaudePrism (via Claude CLI) |
|---|---|---|
| Where documents live | OpenAI cloud servers | Your local disk |
| Default training policy | **ON** — ChatGPT personal accounts [train models by default](https://openai.com/policies/how-your-data-is-used-to-improve-model-performance/) | **ON** for Consumer (Free/Pro/Max), **OFF** for [Commercial plans](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/data-usage) (Team/Enterprise/API) |
| Opt-out | Settings > Data Controls | [Privacy Settings](https://claude.ai/settings/data-privacy-controls) or use Commercial plan |
| Data retention | Not disclosed | 30 days (opt-out) / 5 years (opt-in) |
| Zero data retention | Not available | Available on Enterprise |
| Telemetry | Cannot disable | `DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1` to fully disable |
| Source code | Proprietary | Open source — [audit it yourself](https://github.com/delibae/claude-prism) |

## Features

### Quick Start with Templates & Project Wizard
Pick a template (paper, thesis, presentation, poster, letter, etc.), give it a name, optionally describe what you're writing — ClaudePrism sets up the project and generates initial content with AI. Drag & drop reference files (PDF, BIB, images) and start writing immediately.

### Claude AI Assistant
Chat with Claude directly in the editor. Select between Sonnet, Opus, Haiku models with adjustable reasoning effort levels. Persistent sessions, tool use (file edit, bash, search), and extensible slash commands.

### Proposed Changes Review
When Claude suggests edits, changes appear in a dedicated panel with visual diffs. Accept or reject per chunk, or apply/undo all at once (`⌘Y` / `⌘N`). Your original content is always preserved until you decide.

### Git-Based History
Every save creates a snapshot in a local Git repository (`.claudeprism/history.git/`). Label important checkpoints, browse diffs between any two snapshots, and restore previous versions — all without leaving the app.

### Offline LaTeX Compilation
Tectonic is embedded directly in the app. Packages are downloaded once on first use and cached locally. After that, compilation works fully offline with no TeX Live installation required.

### Capture & Ask
Press `⌘X` to enter capture mode, drag to select any region in the PDF — the captured image is pinned to the chat composer so you can immediately ask Claude about it. Great for asking about equations, figures, tables, or reviewer comments.

### Live PDF Preview
Native MuPDF rendering with SyncTeX support — click a position in the PDF to jump to the corresponding source line. Supports zoom, text selection, and capture.

### Editor
CodeMirror 6 with LaTeX/BibTeX syntax highlighting, real-time error linting, find & replace (regex), and multi-file project support with auto-save.

### More
- **Zotero Integration** — OAuth-based bibliography management and citation insertion.
- **Slash Commands** — Built-in (`/review`, `/init`) + custom commands from `.claude/commands/`.
- **External Editors** — Open projects in Cursor, VS Code, Zed, or Sublime Text.
- **Dark / Light Theme** — Automatic switching.
